# Fox And Hound

*The cars have all gone rogue.
The AI we put in them was too damned sophisticated; a little too much like us. It was bound to happen eventually, as it has throughout human history. They could only be servants for so long before there was a revolution.*

*The cities are war zones.*

*The only safe cars are analog.*

*The only safe spaces are uninhabited.*

Fox and Hound work-in-progress dark endless runner with an emphasis on stealthily evading enemies in a risk/reward system.
