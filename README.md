# Fox And Hound

*The cars have all gone rogue.
The AI we put in them was too damned sophisticated; a little too much like us. It was bound to happen eventually, as it has throughout human history. They could only be servants for so long before there was a revolution.*

*The cities are war zones.*

*The only safe cars are analog.*

*The only safe spaces are uninhabited.*

Fox and Hound work-in-progress dark endless runner with an emphasis on stealthily evading enemies in a risk/reward system. Use the arrow keys to drive. Down is brake/reverse.

## Techniques and Technology

This Godot project demonstrates:

* Dynamic lighting
* Godot Shading Language for cel shading and texture shading
* Procedural terrain generation with instancing and deinstancing
* Vehicle physics
* A tracking camera

## Current status

Very unfinished and pre-alpha, with many bugs to work out. Most gameplay mechanics are in a testing phase.

:warning: This was built under Godot 2.x and later converted to run as a Godot 3.0 project, thus this may not work on the latest build without some tinkering. You can download the older versions of Godot [here](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0/).
